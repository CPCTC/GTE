# GTE
## Graphics TEst

This is a Vulkan hello triangle program. I made this to learn how Vulkan (and graphics cards in general) work. As a secondary objective, I wanted to see how my RODBUS build system scaled with large codebases. The triangle ended up fine, but I was slightly disappointed by the build system, even if I was ultimately able to do some cool things with it.

Further work:
- Swapchain recreation
- Anti-aliasing
- Don't hardcode vertex data inside the shader
- Remove vestigial text editor code
